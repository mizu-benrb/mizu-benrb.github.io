*My first thimbleful of JavaScript was, to say the least, not the greatest first impression to have.*

Long before I took my first step on Manoa, my first introduction to JavaScript was in a middle school technology class, during a web development section. We had learned HTML and CSS, and with that knowledge, tasked to create a basic website with that knowledge. I had little problems setting up this basic page with the HTML and CSS skills I had learned. Confident, I looked over to my neighbor, just to see that they were trying to implement a fancy widget on their page: an image carousel with 4 different images and cool buttons to navigate through them! Curious, I asked where they got it from, and I quickly tried to implement it myself. I failed. I didn't understand the arcane workings of the weird language the carousel was coded with. It had weird words and even stranger symbols. What were all these parantheses doing? What is a "function"? Why were there semicolons everywhere? I was put off from learning anything further, and thus, I didn't... until now!
